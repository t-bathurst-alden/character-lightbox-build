            <h2 class="lb-heading">Mahito - The Cursed Spirit of Humanity</h2>
            <p class="lb-text">Mahito is a cursed spirit, a creature born from humanity&apos;s fears and hatred. In particular, Mahito is the disaster type curse of Humanity, and thus was born from an innate hatred of the human race. He is only a year old, born on the Halloween before the dreaded Shibuya Incident.<br>Mahito&apos;s cursed technique is Idle Transfiguration, a technique that allows him to change the shape of the soul, and by extension, the body. If this spirit gets so much as a single hand on you, you can die a very violent death. His domain expansion is Self Embodiment of Perfection, something that allows him to directly touch whomever is trapped inside, even without close proximity. Mahito is also one of the only cursed spirits who can use the almost fully sorcerer exclusive ability Black Flash, and he can learn new abilities in an alarmingly quick amount of time, making him a lethal threat.<br>Mahito is a direct parallel to the main character, Yuji Itadori, and thus serves to be the perfect arch nemesis for him. Both are new to the world of sorcery, both are dedicated to exterminating the opposite species, and both are young and learning. Mahito made it a personal mission to break Yuji by slaughtering many of his allies and friends, directly taunting him in the process which inevitably got him killed when he pushed Yuji too far.<br>Mahito sadly died during the Shibuya Incident because the author of the story paired him against people that directly counter his abilities and his own inexperience. Before dying, he experienced fear for the first time, and it was widely considered the best moment in the series because people loathe this character due to him killing off fan favourites.</p>

            <h2 class="lb-heading">Ryomen Sukuna - The King of Curses</h2>
            <p class="lb-text">Ryomen Sukuna is an ancient evil sorcerer from the Heian era who managed to turn his body into a cursed object so he could essentially live forever. He is a human with cursed techniques who was born with two faces and four arms.<br>Sukuna is the most lethal villain in the series, with some of the most notable kills under his belt, yet for some reason people like him more than Mahito.<br>Since Sukuna&apos;s reawakening, he has been inhabiting the soul of Yuji Itadori as his vessel, but sometime in the manga, he manages to take a full form by hopping into Megumi Fushiguro&apos;s body and using him to fight with Satoru Gojo during the legendary Shinjuku fight.</p>

            <h2 class="lb-heading">Kenjaku - The Ancient Mastermind</h2>
            <p class="lb-text">The being known as Kenjaku is probably the most deplorable character in the series. On top of killing people, he also greatly enjoys experimenting on living beings, abusing and manipulating people, and stealing corpses to inhabit.<br>You may have noticed he looks identical to Suguru gets, and that is because he is inhabiting and piloting his corpse. The stitches along his forehead indicates where the little brain creature lives, and this is consistent with all the corpses he has used in the past.<br>This sorcerer has been alive for countless centuries, and has been planning everything bad in the series for a very long time. Most of what happens in the series is directly because of him and his actions.</p>

            <h2 class="lb-heading">Suguru Geto - The Racist Curse User</h2>
            <p class="lb-text">Suguru Geto was once a benevolent sorcerer, studying and going on missions alongside Satoru Gojo as a friend. During the Hidden Inventory arc, Geto experienced the dark reality of the world firsthand, which began growing festering hatred in his heart. This hatred only grew with each detestable mission, each time his friend abandoned him on missions, and each time a close ally died.<br>Eventually, Geto defected from the sorcerers when he massacred an entire village, believing that all evil stemmed from regular humans since they unintentionally cause curses to be born. Since then, Geto had been dedicated to the eradication of regular people, and even tried to start a war until he was killed in the process.</p>
